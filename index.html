        The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are a pair of Android smartphones designed,
        developed, and marketed by Google as part of the Google Pixel product
        line. They serve as the successors to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro,
        respectively. Visually, the phones resemble their respective
        predecessors, with incremental upgrades to their displays and
        performance. Powered by the third-generation Google Tensor
        system-on-chip, Google placed heavy emphasis on their artificial
        intelligenceâ€“powered features, especially in the realm of generative AI
        and photo editing.

    <center><h1>eBay</h1></center>

    <h2>
      based in San Jose, California, that brokers customer to customer and
      retail sales through online marketplaces in 190 markets worldwide. Sales
      occur either via online auctions or "buy it now" instant sales, and the
      company charges commissions to sellers upon sales. eBay was founded by
      Pierre Omidyar in September 1995. It has 134 million yearly active buyers
      worldwide and handled $74 billion in transactions in 2022, 49% of which
      was in the United States. In 2022, the company had a take rate (revenue as
      a percentage of volume) of 13.25%.[1] eBay is used by individuals,
      companies, as well as governments to purchase and sell almost any legal,
      non-controversial item. eBay's auctions use a Vickrey auction (sealed-bid)
      proxy bid system. Buyers and sellers may rate and review each other after
      each transaction, resulting in a reputation system. The eBay service is
      accessible via websites and mobile apps. Software developers can create
      applications that integrate with eBay through the eBay API. Merchants can
      also earn commissions from affiliate marketing programs by eBay.
